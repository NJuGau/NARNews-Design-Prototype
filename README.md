# NARNews-Design-Prototype
A responsive design prototype is made using Axure RP software for an imaginary news application. The prototype consists of a home page, profile page, login page, sign-up page, as well as an about page. Using Axure RP, some logic such as form validation and database-like structure can be made and utilized in this prototype. The news can also be displayed according to the user preferences.
